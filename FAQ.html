<b>Are the venues ADA-compliant?</b><br>
The Poulsbo house has entrance ramps, a first floor bathroom and wrap-around porch that is accessible. The backyard has a gentle slope and the path to beach is unpaved. KCC grounds are ADA-compliant, including the waterfront promenade. There is an elevator from the parking structure directly into KCC.<br><br>

<b>So, Parking?</b><br>
Free off-street parking at the ceremony site along Lutes Rd. <br><br>

Event parking for KCC is $4/car, up to 10 hours, on the GREEN and RED levels only - we have been warned that the blue level is subject to ticketing. <emph>For guests staying at Hampton Inn Bremerton, this is the hotel parking structure. </emph> <br><br>

Fairfield Inn Bremerton is a 5 minute walk (0.2 miles) along 4th Street.<br><br>

Street parking may be available on a first-come, first-serve basis in the downtown corridor for up to three hours, as marked. Bremerton does ticket for reparking on the same day.<br><br>

<b>Is there a shorter version of this shindig?</b><br>
Please celebrate with us during the open house period (photos! food! cocktails! games!), the ceremony, and/or the reception (more food! toasts!). While we'd love to see you all day, it's totally okay to edit your presence due to other commitments. Just let us know either way when you RSVP.<br><br>

<b>What is "Outdoor Dressy Casual"?</b><br>
Basically, we want you to be comfortable for the ceremony and lawn games, but dressy enough for great photos and an (indoor) dinner reception later. The homeowners have asked that we refrain from shoes that would damage their hardwood floors, so please no stilletos or golf shoes.<br><br>
